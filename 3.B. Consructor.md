# Constructor

The main difference between a method and a constructor are:

- it has the same name as that of the class which it belongs to
- constructor doesnt have a return type
- Constructor is automatically called when we create a new object of that class
- If we don’t create a constructor then a default no argument constructor will be created

Like methods, constructor also cant be overloaded in Dart



```dart
class ClassName {
  //variables
  
  //constructor
  ClassName(/*parameteres*/) {
    //variable initialization
  }
}
```

We can also create a single line short constructor if our main work is to just initialize the variables of a class object

```dart
class ClassName {
	//var list
	ClassName (this.variable1, this.variable2, /*and other this.vars*/)
}

void main () {
  ClassName obj1 = ClassName(1,2,/*3,4, etc*/);
}
```

## Named Constructor

As stated earlier we can’t overload constructors like in Java or C++. In place of that we can use optional parameters or Name Constructors in dart.

```dart
class ClassName {
  //variable list
  
  ClassName.NameConstructor1 (/*variable list*/);
  
  ClassName.NamedConstructor2 (/*variable list*/);
}

void main () {
  ClassName obj1 = ClassName.NamedConstructor1();
  ClassName obj2 = ClassName.NamedConstructor2();
}
```
